# Student Performance Analyzer

The **Student Performance Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to analyze student grades and generate detailed performance reports. The system leverages **Pandas** for data manipulation, **Matplotlib** for visualizations, and **scikit-learn** for predicting student performance trends based on historical data. It also uses **PyTest** for unit testing to ensure the integrity of the system.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze student performance from a dataset of grades.
- **Visualization**: Generate visual reports (e.g., histograms, bar charts) to visualize student performance.
- **Performance Prediction**: Predict future student performance trends using machine learning models from **scikit-learn**.
- **Report Generation**: Automatically generate performance reports for students based on their grades.
- **Testing**: Ensure code quality with unit tests using **PyTest**.

## Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations (charts and plots).
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning to predict student performance trends.
- **PyTest**: Python testing framework for unit tests.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. You can install the necessary libraries using **pip**:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pytest
